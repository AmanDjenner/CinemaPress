This is what distinguishes an excellent director from a hack worker who takes pictures for state funding. Nolan wholeheartedly believes in the success of the project, and will take off so many takes until his internal perfectionist is satisfied.",

It should be funny and «explosive», so we will look only on the big screen. Short videos from the trailer sold well on the Internet, let's hope that these are not all the best moments of the film.",

One must have great confidence that the 2nd part will shoot as successfully as the first. But to be completely honest, the first part was drawn by 3D, since the plot [spoiler]completely repeats the actions in the animated film Pocahontas of 1995[/spoiler] Therefore, I don’t know, I don’t know :)",
